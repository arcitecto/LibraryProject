                <h3><u>Title:</u> In Her Shoes (2002)</h3>
                <h3><u>Author:</u> Jennifer Weiner</h3>
                <p><u>Synopsis:</u> From Jennifer Weiner comes a story of two sisters with nothing in common but a love
                    for shoes learn they are more alike than they thought possible.</p>
                <p>Meet Rose Feller, a thirty-year-old high-powered attorney with a secret passion for romance novels.
                    She has an exercise regime she's going to start next week, and she dreams of a man who will slide
                    off her glasses, gaze into her eyes, and tell her she's beautiful. She also dreams of getting her
                    fantastically screwed-up semi-employed little sister to straighten up and fly right.</p>
                <p>Meet Rose's sister, Maggie, twenty-eight years old and drop-dead gorgeous. Although her big-screen
                    stardom hasn't progressed past her left hip's appearance in a Will Smith video, Maggie dreams of
                    fame and fortune -- and getting her big sister on a skin-care regimen.</p>
                <p>These two women, who claim to have nothing in common but a childhood tragedy, DNA, and the same sized
                    feet, are about to learn that they are more alike than they'd ever imagined. Along the way, they'll
                    encounter a diverse cast of characters -- from a stepmother who's into recreational Botox to a
                    disdainful pug with no name. They'll borrow shoes and clothes and boyfriends, and eventually make
                    peace with their most intimate enemies -- each other.</p>
