                <h3><u>Title:</u> The People We Hate At the Wedding (2016)</h3>
                <h3><u>Author:</u> Grant Ginder</h3>
                <p><u>Synopsis:</u> Paul and Alice's half-sister Eloise is getting married! In London! There will be
                    fancy hotels, dinners at "it" restaurants and a reception at a country estate complete with
                    tealights and embroidered cloth napkins. They couldn't hate it more.</p>
                <p>The People We Hate at the Wedding is the story of a less than perfect family. Donna, the clan's
                    mother, is now a widow living in the Chicago suburbs with a penchant for the occasional joint and
                    more than one glass of wine with her best friend while watching House Hunters International. Alice
                    is in her thirties, single, smart, beautiful, stuck in a dead-end job where she is mired in a rather
                    predictable, though enjoyable, affair with her married boss. Her brother Paul lives in Philadelphia
                    with his older, handsomer, tenured track professor boyfriend who's recently been saying things like
                    "monogamy is an oppressive heteronormative construct," while eyeing undergrads. And then there's
                    Eloise. Perfect, gorgeous, cultured Eloise.The product of Donna's first marraige to a dashing
                    Frenchman. Eloise has spent her school years at the best private boarding schools, her winter
                    holidays in St. John and a post college life cushioned by a fat, endless trust fund. To top it off,
                    she's infuriatingly kind and decent.</p>
                <p>As this estranged clan gathers together, and Eloise's walk down the aisle approaches, Grant Ginder
                    brings to vivid, hilarious life the power of family, and the complicated ways we hate the ones we
                    love the most bitingly funny, slyly witty and surprisingly tender novel you'll read this year.</p>
